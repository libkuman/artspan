Student Rally: Demand Mayor Lee Take Action Now to Save CCSF!Tuesday, August 20, 4pm, SF Civic CenterCity  College provides an excellent education to tens of thousands of  students, yet the ACCJC accreditation commission is threatening to close  our school in 2014. We will not let this happen! CCSF must remain open  and accessible to the Bay Area's diverse communities. Students will  march on City Hall to pressure Mayor Ed Lee to demand the immediate  reversal of the ACCJC's unjust decision, which is currently under  appeal. If the Mayor actually supports CCSF and its students, he needs  to join with us to take action against the ACCJC -- an illegitimate, out  of control body -- and its imposition of cuts and privatization.&amp;nbsp;Save CCSF.

In 2000 she was hired by Golden Artist Colors, as the Golden Working  Artist in San Francisco. Her work is collected both locally and  internationally with patrons as far away as Tokyo, and her paintings  employ bold color and texture. She received her BFA from the Academy of  Art in 1984, studied lithography at the San Francisco Art Institute in  1990 and received her Master's of Art in 1992 at John F. Kennedy  University in Orinda, California.\n\nShannon Del Vecchio is a feng shui consultant and interior designer who has had a thriving  practice in the Bay Area for nearly 20 years. Shannon is fascinated by  the role that color plays in shaping the emotional impact of  environments where we live and work, and she has developed detailed  color designs for a wide range of applications - from private residences  to fitness, hospitality, retail and healthcare.\n\nToni Lobsenz is an experienced, professional textile and surface designer with over  35 years of experience working in Industry as well as a ﬁne art painter.  Color is her forte. She has expertise in color development, theory and  psychology of color, both in art and in Industry. She was Head designer  and senior designer for companies including Pottery Barn for 12 years  and Esprit for 6 years, as well as a freelance designer for many well  known companies. Toni has taught in the Foundations and Fashion Depts of  the Academy of Art and in the Interior Design and Fashion Depts at CCA.  Her educational background is in Fine Art and art history.\n\nJulia Rowe is an arts educator who most recently spent two decades at the  California College of the Arts where she was first Core Director, then  Associate Dean of Students. &amp;nbsp;Trained at Harvard, The New York Studio  School and briefly at RISD, Julia is drawn to work where humanities  research intersects with studio practice.&amp;nbsp;Currently she is spending a  lot of time drawing in her studio where, despite her interest in color,  much of her work seems to be in black and white.\n\nModerated by Michele King. Michele King is a visual artist whose work is about the stories and sensory associations triggered by our surroundings (aka &ldquo;the poetics of place&rdquo;). King has exhibited in San Francisco, Barcelona, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and Paris. &amp;nbsp;She also has a background in urban design with an interest making cities more livable and inclusive. Michele graduated from Harvard University and Virginia Tech, and participated in an experimental collaboration lab at Columbia University School of the Arts.\n\nExhibition on Display:\n\nCurated by Jon Sueda and featuring 37 projects by Bay Area and international artists, All Possible Futures is the first of three SOMArts Commons Curatorial Residency exhibitions  in 2014. The group exhibition explores the potential of graphic design  and celebrates a questioning of boundaries regarding concepts,  processes, technologies, and form. Contemporary speculative pieces take  the form of both physical objects and restaged installations.\n\nWhat  happens when graphic designers extend the boundaries of their  discipline and initiate creative explorations built on risk and  uncertain ground? Exhibited conceptual proposals, critical provocations,  and experimental works that exist on the margins of graphic design or  in parallel to professional projects, as well as proposals that were  initially rejected by a client and remain unrealized, position All Possible Futures at the intersection of design and fine art.\n\nArtSpan  participates in SOMArts&rsquo; Affordable Space Program, which provides  below-market rental space, production and publicity assistance to arts  and cultural organizations.&amp;nbsp;For more information visit&amp;nbsp;http://www.somarts.org/rentals/.<\/body><\/html>"},{"EventID":"19812","Name":"Life Drawing Mixer at Blick!","StartDate":"2014-02-13 17:00:00","EndDate":"2014-02-13 20:00:00","ImageURL":"http://artspan.org/sites/default/files/2212ArtSpanMixer%20E1%20Landing.jpg","Address":"Blick Art Materials,979 Market Street,San Francisco,CA,94103,us","Description":"<html><body><\/body><\/html>"},{"EventID":"19813","Name":"All About Auctions - Art Curious Panel and Auction Preview","StartDate":"2014-03-27 18:00:00","EndDate":"2014-03-27 20:00:00","ImageURL":"http://artspan.org/sites/default/files/auctions101.jpg","Address":"SOMArts Cultural Center,934 Brannan Street,San Francisco,CA,94103,us","Description":"<html><body>Save the Date!
