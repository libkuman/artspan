I attended Seattle Film Institute focusing on screenwriting in 2003/2004. Since July 2004, I am a husband; March 2006, a father; and November 2007, a painter of acrylics on canvas. In June of 2012, I transitioned to be a full-time working artist and (as of August 2012) an Alternative Energy Healer/Facilitator of Consciousness.I relocated to California from Seattle in 2013 and have exhibited in numerous Seattle venues. I have had work on display at the Alki Arts Gallery since August of 2010 and have work showing at Alki Arts/Harbor Steps as well as in Meyer Wells, Seattle Design Center.I was a contributing artist to the 2012 and 2013 Artist Trust Benefit Auctions. In addition, proceeds from my work have benefitted Deep Roots (deeproots.org), Alki Elementary School, DAWN (Domestic Abuse Women's Network), PAVE (Partnerships for Action, Voices for Empowerment) and the Alzheimer's Association. My art is in private collections in the northwest and beyond.I experiment in abstract nature, figures, colors, concepts, and process. Thematically, I consistently explore the boundaries of reality. I am an artist for change.<\/html>","Website":["http://jasonastorquia.com","http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jason-Sinclair-Astorquia/162681737130391"],"Artwork":[{"Name":"Amalgam","ImageURL":"http://artspan.org/sites/default/files/amalgam.jpg","Description":"From my Impressions series...paintings all created using the impression of coins.
